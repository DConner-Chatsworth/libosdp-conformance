If you've never tested your OSDP implementation against anyone else, read
the FIRST CONTACT document first.

Tests are listed in the spreadsheet. This is supposed to track the committee copy of the spreadsheet on the sharepoint.

To set up your own gear to run the conformance test, see
"testbed-setup-for-conformance.pdf"

Read doc/conformance/test-plan-overview and then the spreadsheet(s) in the doc/conformance directory.

LibreOffice document format is used.  No known MS/Office compatibility issues.
