Release 0.4 Build 1 libosdp-conformance
=======================================

Changes in 0.4 Build 1
----------------------

started adding extended packet mode log messages
release notice cleaned up in doc directory

Change Details
--------------

Monitor mode now decodes some (not all) application-specific messages for
PIV processing.

Known Issues
------------
The raw dump portion of the monitor output for osdp_MFG and osdp_MFGREP 
messages is not always precisely the (remaining payload after all headers.)
Also the raw dump isn't chunked out into lines, it's one long line.  This should
be modified to make it easier to use.

secure channel not completely implemented
bio processing not completely implemented
NAK processing doesn't invoke retry
checksum vs. crc switching may not match other devices
Check issues list in github.
