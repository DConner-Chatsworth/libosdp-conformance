Build Instructions for libosdp-conformance

This assumes you are building in a Debian/Ubuntu/Devuan environment but it 
should look like fairly normal Linux tools.

Set-up:
- performed standard debian update and package set-up
  apt-get update
  apt-get upgrade
  apt-get install build-essential
  apt-get install clang lzip pkg-config libgmp3-dev libgmpxx4ldbl screen
  apt-get install tcpdump gdb apache2 git

- install the dev package for jansson

- NOTE the default make file does not build TLS.
  for TLS, install the dev package for libtasn, nettle, and gnutls.  gnutls' package
  installer will pull in libtasn and nettle if needed.

Build:
assumes you are user "osdp" when you do this, and have "sudo".
assumes you do this in /opt/osdp-conformance/setup/libosdp-conformance.

  sudo mkdir -p /opt/osdp-conformance/setup
  sudo chown -R osdp:osdp /opt/osdp-conformance
  cd /opt/osdp-conformance/setup
  git clone https://github.com/security-industry-association/libosdp-conformance
  cd libosdp-conformance
  make clean
  make release
  cd /
  tar xzvf /opt/osdp-conformance/setup/libosdp-conformance/release-libosdp.tgz
  ...copy /opt/osdp-conformance/cgi-bin to your cgi-bin directory if necessary
  ...copy /opt/osdp-conformance/www to your www directory if necessary

Installation:
(current build runs as a CP only.)

    cd /opt/osdp-conformance/run/CP
    cp open-osdp-params-CP.json open-osdp-params.json
    ... set baud rate and PD address, other parameters

At this point the web UI should work at http://tester/osdp-conforamance-CP.html.
Logs are being placed in /opt/osdp-conformance/run/CP and /opt/osdp-conformance/log.
