Build Instructions for libosdp-conformance

This assumes you are building in a Debian/Ubuntu/Devuan environment but it 
should look like fairly normal Linux tools.

Set-up:
- performed standard debian update and package set-up
  apt-get update
  apt-get upgrade
  apt-get install build-essential
  apt-get install clang lzip pkg-config libgmp3-dev libgmpxx4ldbl screen
  apt-get install tcpdump gdb apache2 git

- install the dev package for jansson
- for TLS, install the dev package for libtasn, nettle, and gnutls.  gnutls' package
  installer will pull in libtasn and nettle if needed.

Build:
WARNING THIS WILL CHANGE WHEN THE REPO MOVES TO THE SIA REPO
